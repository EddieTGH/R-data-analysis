# Data Engineering Projects in R
## Data Visualization, Wrangling, and Tidying
This repository contains 3 projects/labs that dive deep into data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using R. Click into each project/lab and open the pdf files to see what was done.

### Project 1: Data Visualization
This project focuses on a midwest dataframe and utilizes ggplot() and various geoms() to create different visualizations (scatterplots, box plots, histograms, bar plots, etc.) and corresponding explanations to analyze data and tell a story.

### Project 2: Data Wrangling
This project focuses on a midwest dataframe and utilizes various different dplyr functions including summarise(), count(), arrange(), filter(), mutate(), select(), group_by(), etc. in order to transform the data to tell a more complete story.

### Project 3: Data Tidying
This project focuses on various dataframes centered around inflation rates per country and CPI indices. I worked on on tidying up the data utilizing various different dplyr functions and wrangling it utilizing pivot_wider / pivot_longer and the join function to join different dataframes together to tell the most complete story I have told thus far.
